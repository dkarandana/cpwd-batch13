							<strong>"We needed to get serious"</strong><br>

							That's the message from Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who kicked off 2018 with an open letter in which he pledged to fix the myriad of issues that have flared up in the past year.
							The first step this year concerns his own attention, which will be more wide ranging than managing decisions and shaping the company's rules. That includes bringing "groups of experts together," he said in the post Thursday.
							"These issues touch on questions of history, civics, political philosophy, media, government, and of course technology," he added.

							At its annual September iPhone event, which took place on September 12, Apple unveiled three new iPhones: the iPhone 8, the iPhone 8 Plus, and the iPhone X. While the iPhone X is the new high-end flagship device, the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 Plus both feature some major improvements.<br>
							Like the iPhone X, the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 Plus feature an all-glass design, with new aluminum-framed glass bodies available in Space Gray, Gold, and Silver. Apple uses a seven-layer color process for "precise" hue and opacity, and the devices are constructed from the most durable glass ever used in a smartphone.

					<h5>Jennifer coding story...</h5>
					<img src="images/jenny.jpg" alt="jennifer">
					A few months ago, Treehouse student and moderator, Jennifer Nordell, caught our eye in the Treehouse Community. Not only had she worked her way through a phenomenal number of courses, she was also an incredibly active and valuable member of the Community, answering hundreds of student questions in a diverse range of topics. Although she’d been a student for less than a year, Jennifer had already racked up thousands of points on her Treehouse profile (she’s reached over 100k now). We were so impressed by Jennifer’s progress that we asked to virtually meet her to hear more about her story and her incredible drive to learn<br>
					After spending time with Jennifer, it came to light that she isn’t just an impressive student, she’s also an inspirational individual with a unique backstory that ties to her coding. In recent years, Jennifer has lived with a disability that restricts her from being able to work a regular 9-5 job. As a result, Jennifer searched for other outlets for her time. Coding is something that comes naturally to Jennifer and is something she enjoys, so using her free time to expand her coding skills and helping others progress became a valuable focus.<br>
					We asked Jennifer if we could share her experience becoming a developer with the community.

					<h5>Amanda Bates</h5>
					<img src="images/amanda.jpg" alt="amanda">
					A basic web design class in high school introduced Amanda to a passion for the web. However, it wasn’t until 10 years later, when Amanda was stuck in a dead end job that she decided to go back to college to pursue a career in tech.<br>
					At 27, Amanda enrolled in an Information Studies degree at university. During the first semester a web design course reaquainted Amanda with her passion for web design and confirmed that it was the next career path for her. With limited web design and development courses included in her major, Amanda turned to online learning resources. Treehouse was the perfect fit for her learning needs and goals.<br>
					This month, Amanda started her exciting new career as a web developer and is finally doing what she loves.<br>
					We asked Amanda to share her experience embarking on a new tech career.
